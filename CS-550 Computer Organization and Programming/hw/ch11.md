#11.5 “ As described in the text, the PCI-Express bus consists of thirty-two “lanes“. As of January 2009, each lane is capable of the maximum data rate of 500 MB per second. Lanes are allocated to a device 1,2,3,8,16, or 32 lanes at a time.

Assume that a PCI-Express bus is to be connected to a high-definition video card that is supporting a 1920 x 1080 true color (3 bytes per pixel) progressive scan monitor with a refresh rate of 60 frames per second. How many lanes will this video card require to support the monitor at full capability?”

Video Rate = (1920*1080) pixels/frames * 3 bytes * 60 frames/second = 373,248,000 bytes/second 
Video Transmission Rate = 373,248,000 / 1024 / 1024 MB/second = 355.95 MB/second.
Since this is smaller than 500mb/seconds, only one lane is needed.

#11.7 “How many PCI-Express lanes are required to support a 10gb per second Ethernet card?”

In a single PCI-Express position, there are lanes that are based off powers of two. You need two pairs for each lane such as PCI 4.0/x4 which can handle around 8GB/second. Meaning you it would require two sets of pairs calling for 4 lanes.
