13. II) How many connections are required for 30 nodes to be connected in a full mesh topology? (Calculation Exercise)

= 30*29/.20 = 435 connections

III) Each individual link channel is characterized by a number of different properties. Some of them are a) type of medium, b) signaling method, c) directionality of signals, d) nature of the interfaces with the end nodes, and with other links. What are the other properties? (Please type your answer; this is not a calculation exercise)

Some important properties are link bandwidth and an extension of that is the restrictions that exist upon these links. Then there is the number connections that exist in each channel and whether or not they are guided or unguided. Also the time it takes for a channel, the electric properties of the channel (potential resistance), the length of the channel, and overall the noise on it.
