13.1) In the Ethernet frame described in the text (figure 13.5 page # 410), what are the minimum and the maximum number of bytes?

Minimum:
Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter = 8 Bytes
Dest/Source MAC = 12 Bytes
Data = 2 Bytes
Payload Min = 46 Bytes
CRC = 4 Bytes

Minimum = Sum of Above  = 72 Bytes

Maximum:
Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter = 8 Bytes
Dest/Source MAC = 12 Bytes
Data = 2 Bytes
Payload Max = 1500 Bytes
CRC = 4 Bytes

Maxium = Sum of Above = 1526 Bytes

13.2) Suppose a higher layer application wants to send a file 12MB in size across an Ethernet LAN. How many Ethernet frames are needed? Assume the largest Ethernet payload is 1500 bytes.

12*1024*1024/1500 = 8389 Ethernet Frames
