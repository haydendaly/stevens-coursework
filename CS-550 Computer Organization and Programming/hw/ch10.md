3 (A) â€“ A multiplattered hard disk is divided into 1100 sectors and 40,000 cylinders. There are six platter surfaces. Each block holds 512 bytes. The disk is rotating a rate of 4800 rpm. The disk has an average seek time of msec. What is the total capacity of this disk?

The total capacity of the disk would be 1100*40000*6*512 = 135168000000

10.4 (A)- The average latency on a disk with 2200 sectors is found experimentally to be 110 msec. What is the rotating speed of the disk?

The rotational speed of the disk would be 1/(2*110) = 0.00454

[I] For a display of 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels at 16 bits per pixel how much memory, in megabytes, is needed to store the image?

1920*1080*2/1048576 = 3.96MB

[II] What is the average rotational latency of a hard drive rotating at 7,200 RPM or 120 revolutions per second? (Give your answer in milliseconds)

1/(2*120) = 4.17msec

[III] What is the transfer time for a hard drive rotating at 7,200 RPM or 120 revolutions per second? Assume there are 30 sectors per track. (Give your answer in milliseconds)

1/(30*120) = .2083msec
