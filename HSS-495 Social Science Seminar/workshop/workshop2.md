# Workshop 2

## South Park Clip

### Outline

- South Park is satire, very offensive -> sorry if this offended anyone.
- This is just a segment of the episode itself -> potentially review plot.
- George Test measures satire by four characteristics: aggression, play, laughter, and judgement.
	- Clearly aggressive toward trans in sports
	- Not a lot of clear play as the joke is out in the open and offensive
	- Laughter is present from the absurd presentation
	- Judgement overlaps with agressive and questions trans in sports
- Later Mutgers, van Mulken, and Schellens break down irony into: evaluativeness, incongruity, valence, a target, and relevance to the current context.
	- One of these points I want to highlight is the incongruity which is present in this clip between the literal and actual presentation.
- Resource allocation theory applies
	- In the context of humor, there are two tasks that are incompatible with one another:
		1. getting and appreciating the joke
		2. scrutinizing and critiquing the argument presented in the joke
	- A thing South Park does remarkably well in this season is the character of PC Principal
		- In this clip, he is shown at a low point but throughout the episode he directly scruitinizes the offensive nature of South Park causing a dissonance in the resource allocation theory
		- Since this side is voiced, they are acutally mimicking the perceived overly politically correct nature of the audience.
