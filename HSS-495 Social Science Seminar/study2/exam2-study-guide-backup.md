## Young 2020

### Ch. 2 & 3

3 key steps in deregulation of media (1980s) & association with profit-oriented media (p. 33-36)
    * Included 1) FCC removal of required informational programming, 2) repealing Fairness Doctrine (i.e. "equal time" for competiting voices, 3) reduced limits on media ownership (i.e. monopolies developed)
    * Led to increased focused on profit and media conglomeration by big corporations
    * In '80s, 50 different companies owned most of American media. By 2000, 6 large corporations did so.
    * "Media deregulation means fewer - and much larger - corporate owners of media" (p. 35)

Hostile Media Effect (p. 41)
    * Viewers perceive balanced news reporting to be hostile toward their own ideological position, an effect that is especially concerning in sharply divided political climate.

Media choice and mass audience (efficient separation advertising) (p. 47)
    * Media choice is as technology advances, more ways to absorb media have arised eliminating the prior mass audiences with shows like I Love Lucy which was watched by 73% of Americans that own TVs while Sunday Night Football is 6%. Death of mass audience caused by rise in media choice.
    * Efficient separation means the rise of niche audiences. Advertising to niches creating small homogeneous audiences which removes politics from everyday life and focuses in on these small niches.

Outrage & satire as reactions to perceived problematic aspects media/environment (p. 48)
    * Second generation of changes in the 1990s. Young focuses on how both are outgrowths of perceived problematic aspects both fueled by rising political polarization, media distrust, and made possible by changing technologies.
    * Satire and comedians see bias as profit driven news (critique of system).
    * Outrage is critique of ideological bias in left-wing media.

### Ch. 4 & 5

Test's 4 Characteristics (p. 69)
    * Satire is defined by four characteristics: aggression, play, laughter, and judgement.
        * Aggression is the notion that satire embodies the spirit of attack.
        * Play refers to the fact that humor operates like a riddle that must be solved, often including allusions to silly or strange constructs.
        * Laugther captures the mirth anticipated by, and derived from, a satirical message.
        * Judgement is the notion that satire presents a valenced, evaluatative argument aimed at a target--usually an insitution, a policy, a practice or society as a whole.
    * Aggression and judgement separate satire from other kinds of humor.
        * "Satire ultimately judges, it asserts that some person, group, or attitude is not what it should be. However restrained, muted, or disguised a playful judgement may be, whatever form it takes, such an act undermines, threatens, and perhaps violates, the target, making an attack."

Role of incongruity in humor (e.g. Koestler's frames of reference) (p. 70-71)
    * In his 1964 work The Act of Creation, Koestler considers various aspects of the imagination and the human need to create--music, art, fiction, and humpr. He argues that humor is created when a text (like a joke) activates one frame of reference in a person's mind, which is then followed by the introduction of a totally different frame of reference that seems fundamentally at odds with the first. 
        * To understand what the humorous text means, it is up to the listener reconcile the ingruity.
    * Figure 4.1 visualizes his concepts of incongruity and bisocation quite well.

Murgers, van Mulken, & Schellens' five "irony factors" (p. 75-76)
    * Irony includes: evaluativeness, incongruity, valence, a target, and relevance to the current context.
        * Evaluative in that it issues a valenced judgement about something.
        * Relies on incongruity between the literal and actual meanings of a text. 
        * Requires inversion of valence (positive assessments are really negative and vice versa).
        * Aimed at a target.
        * Irony must be directly or indirectly relevant, context-specific form of judgement, aimed at a target; and its literal and intended meanings are at odds with one another.

Young's resource allocation theory (p. 79-80)
    - Contrast with Nabi's discounting cue hypothesis
    * Resource allocation theory there is not enough time to both scrutinize / appreciate a joke.
    * Satire takes more work to interept and doesn't leave enough room to counterargue.
    * Nabi suggests the mechanism isn't resources but rather the lack of motivation as it is a joke.
    * Young cites support for both theories. 
        * More absorbed audience is in the funny part, the less they'll counterargue indicating support for resource allocation theory.

Scalar Humor (aka Exaggeration/Hyperbole) (p. 83-84)
    * "Scalar humor is the manipulation of a conceptual scale," often through exaggeration or hyperbole.
    * "Yo mama so far, she broke her arm and gravy poured out."
    * Unlike irony which requires an inversion of valence, in scalar humor, hyperbole, and exaggeration, the literal and intended valence is the same.

Satire (aka irony) (p. 74-75)
    * Political satire is frequently presented through irony--literally stating one thing while meaning the opposite.
    * Ironic juxtapositions are contrasting "the real and the ideal" or "what is and what ought to be".

Arrado's humor appreciation criteria (p. 87)
    * "All other things being equal, a humorous text will be perceived as humorous if the incongruity/resolution is non-threatening, not too complex or too simple, based on available scripts/knowledge, unexpected, surprising, and occurs in a playful mode (the situation must be framed as humor)."
    * Dependent on context/audience and different people might be more willing, or less willing, to perceive a joke in a way that meets each criterion.

### Ch. 6 & 7

Need for cognition (p. 101)
    * How much some people enjoy thinking--and how it contributes to their appreciation for complex jokes.
    * People high in need for cognition are more appreciative of humor in general, likely because it requires cognitive work to reconcile the incongruity.
    * Also shapes how people process different forms of information or aesthetic forms they appreciate, seek out, and enjoy.

Tolerance for ambiguity (p. 101-102)
    * Need for cognition is high in people who are tolerant of ambiguity. Tolerance for ambiguity is a key trait that contributes to artistic and aesthetic preferences. Also known in association with its converse, need for closure, tolerance of ambiguity refers to how comfortable an individual is with novelty and uncertainty.
        * High tolerance adapt easily to new situations, open to new experiences, and tend to reject structure, order, and predictability.
        * Low tolerance are less comfortable with new experiences and tend to prefer routines, order, structure, and predictability.

Relationship of both attitudes to 1) aesthetic preferences 2) ideology (p. 102-103)

Young's 2 types of humor (irony and exaggeration) (p. 124-125)
    * Identifies two different kinds of humor: one relying on ironic inversion and the other relying on a simple heightening of the comic's actual point of view. The former is simply the concept of irony and the second is hyperbole or exaggeration.
    - What does each require of the audience?
        * Hyperbole is a description of the state of affairs in obliviously exaggerated terms. Whereas irony requires that the listener invert the literal valence of the speaker to infer what the speaker actually means.
        * Hyperbole requires much less cognitive work to perceive. Irony is a form of communication that is inherently ambigious and, as such, is cognitively taxing.
        * Given conservatives' lower tolerance for ambiguity and need for cognition than liberals', the unique complexity and ambiguity of irony makie it less likely that conservatives would enjoy it.

Openness to experience - relationship with humor appreciation and humor production (p. 132-133)

### Ch. 8 & 9

Outrage media (description, tone, content) (p. 141-142)
    * Outrage as a function of such programming's tone, content, and tactics.
        * The tone is emotional, angry, and fearful.
        * The content is personality centered with a given program, column, or blog defined by a dominant charismatic voice.
        The tactics are engaging and ruthless. Specific tactics include hyperbole, sensationalism, ad hominem attacks, ridiculem extreme language, and "proving" that an opponent is a hypocrite. Unveiling enemies and convincing audience that they are correct.

Figure 8.7 & 8.8 (p. 151-152)
    * Figure 8.7 is predicted exposure to Rush Limbaugh as a function of tolerance for ambiguity and political ideology.
        * Likelihood of listening to Limbaugh. If you have a high need for closure / low amibiguity tolerance and matches your conservative, you're more likely to listen. As tolerance increases as liberal, you become more likely to listen and as a conservative, less likely.
    * Figure 8.8 is predicted exposure to The Daily Show as a dunction of tolerance for amibiguity and political ideology.
        * High need for closure is around the same. As tolerance for ambiguity increases, liberals are much more likely but conservatives less likely.
    * Shows for psychological differences can help determine your behavior.
    * In general, positive/negative relationships based on a program dependent on your ambiguity and ideology.

Hybridity (p. 156)
    * Blending a loss of distinction, a process of de-differentiation. What were once seen as essentialized categories... have become replaced by unstable mixtures and uncertain assemblages.
    * Conservatives are more stay in line while liberals allow hybridity between roles.

Functions and outcomes (definitions) (p. 169)
    * Functions are the reasons why audiences use the shows explored both through self-reported veiwing motivations (why people say they watch a certain program) and viewing orientations (whether audiences categorize that program as news, entertainment, or something else). Outcomes on the other hand are the effects of exposure: the consequences of viewing these shows.
    * These rankings are shown on Figure 9.1 in how people classify news.
    * Functions is why an audience watches and outcomes are effects of exposure to the show.

Association between audiences and political knowledge, education, etc. (p. 180-184)
    * Audience drawn to satire have higher political knowledge and education levels.
    * Drawn to Fox News have lower education levels in general.
    * Liberals tend to be more intelligent. 

Framing (p. 182)
    * Ways programs go about presenting their news. Behavioral, attitude, and targetted outcomes in the strategy of media reporting.
    * Which information is being presented.
    * Outrage is often reiterating while entertainment can introduce new information.
    * You frame issues differently and it has different outcomes/perceptions

Outcomes of satire and irony (efficacy, participation, information seeking, etc.) (p. 185-188)
    * Audiences of both satire and outrage programs are among the most politically engaged and participatory (i.e. attend events, donate money, volunteer, talk politics more, watch more closely, seek out more information).
        * Satire increases efficacy (and indirect participation such as information seeking) (p. 187). Can occur through the gateway hypothesis wherein political entertainment opens the door to more closely following "hard news" of politics.
            * Efficacy is the two parts: 1) internal = I am able to participate in politics meaningfully (I am capable), 2) external = my voice matters in the system (government is responsive to me or people like me. Cynicism can be marked by high internal efficacy by low external efficacy (see Gamson hypothesis)) (p. 188)
        * Outrage increases anger and participation directly in terms of voter turnout and mobilization (p. 185)
            * Anger & perception of control fits with conservative's reliance on heuristics, black/white thinking.

Gamson hypothesis (p. 188)
    * Low trust and high efficacy is a potent combination that helps start the fires of protests.
        * If you don't trust the government but think you can make a difference, you're more likely to be mobilized and take some type of action.
    * What role does it play in events like the insurrection / BLM protests?
        * People think they should have a say on each side of the political aisle. They have a sense of where to place blame for issues.
