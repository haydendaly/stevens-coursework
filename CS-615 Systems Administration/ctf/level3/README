1. Tried ssh'ing back into previous challenge machines and was able to get in, a bunch of confusing files were present.

2. Ran nmap from personal computer, got the ports:
    22 ssh
    80 http
    443 https
    554 rtsp?
    587 smtp
    7070 realserver?

- Booted up a naive instance in sa-east-1 (based on ; DROP Table's public hint)
    - used nmap, got:
        22
        25 (filtered)
        80
        443
        587
    - tried accessing the files, no changes from before.

3. We tried scp'ing files locally to see them like readthe and ssh-keys in pilosa but didn't really work. ./readthe was an executable so tried doing `./readthe ssh-keys/README` but this forced us where we couldn't quit. Instead of exiting, it taunted us so we tried different ways to quit and like ctrl + \ which returned the date and a taunting message saying "Oh my, is that the time? Gotta go, gotta go...".

4. This means that this is vulnerable for a code injection if we create our own "date" script in `/home/ham`. Our shell script is:
	```
	#!/bin/bash
	cd /bin
	./sh
	```

	Which gave us:
		```
		This directory contains the ssh keys needed to
		access cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org, which
		of course can only be accessed from a region
		where anteaters roam free.
		Since these files are kind of important, they
		are backed up regularly using gaeb(8).
		```

5. Looking at the man of `gaeb` aspecified this strange file transfer protocol. We needed to send an email with:
	Subject: "/home/pilosa/ssh-keys/ham.gpg is not a sloth"
	Envelope-From header: "tamandua@cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org"

	And we tried to send an email using mail:
		mail anteater@ctf-level2.stevens.netmeister.org -s "/home/pilosa/ssh-keys/ham.gpg is not a sloth" -f tamandua@cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org

6. We tried telnetting into netmeister's mail server from week 8's video, spent a long while wondering why we couldn't email to anyone in ctf-level2.
	- Using panix kept giving us relay access denied errors when trying to send to anyone in ctf-level2.
		telnet 166.84.7.99 25

7. Used telnet to ctf-level2.stevens.netmeister.org and got access to our private key from /home/pilosa/ssh-keys.
	- Turns out we didn't need to actually access a mail server to send an email,  we just needed to send to someone locally.
		telnet ctf-level2.stevens.netmeister.org 25
		EHLO localhost
		MAIL FROM: <tamandua@cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org>
		RCPT TO: <anteater@ctf-level2.stevens.netmeister.org.>
		DATA
		From: <ham@ctf-level2.stevens.netmeister.org.>
		To: <anteater@ctf-level2.stevens.netmeister.org.>
		Subject: /home/pilosa/ssh-keys/ham.gpg is not a sloth
		.
		quit

8. We set up the VPC the same way as HW2, just in sa-east-1 (we found this out from a hint another team "bought" through the mailing list).

9. We redid the port scan on cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org using ipv6 (another team gave us a hint to scan ipv6 like we did for homeworks 2 and 3). This showed us port 2244 and we were able to ssh in using the private key from pilosa.

	SSHing gave us the message:
		```
		Sorry, no ants on this port.
		```
	and asked for a password.

	Using "is not a sloth" didn't work, so the "Sorry, no ants" message is our answer attempt #1.

10. Bonus: We forgot the -p flag for ssh in a state of exhaustion.
	```
	Congratulations!  You've completed Level 3!

	The passphrase to unlock level 4 is:
	An anteater's tongue can be up to 2' long.

	Come back here to complete level 4 and then capture the flag!
	Connection to cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org closed.
